1. The following arithemetic operations are availble:
-----------------------------------------------------
	+, -, /*, /	addition, subtraction, multiply, divide
	var++		Increase the variable var by 1
	var--		Decrease the variable var by 1
	%		Modulus (Return the remainder after division)

2. We can issue anyone of these operations within a bash script by "simply" using the `let` command, for example:
$ let a=5+4 // a = 9
$ let "a = 5 + 4" // a = 9
NOTE: in both cases, the fact that we indicated the variable `a` to be assgined with the result, ALSO, defined it, so it can be further used
after the above command (i.e.- we ca use `$ echo $a` to display its value).

3. We can also use the `expr` command which acts very similar to `let` only it can contain spaces between the expressions and it automatically outputs the
result to the screen (STDOUT).

4. We can also use the double paranthesses along with the "extraction" of value together, like so:
$ res=$((4 + 3)) // res = 7

5. To get the length of a variable, i.e.- how many characters it is composed from, chars and/or digits (or basically any valid character)
we can use the following:
$ var1='Hello World!!`
$ echo "var1 composed of ${#var1} characters"
